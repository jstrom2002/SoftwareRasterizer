# Software Rasterizer
#### Minimal Software Rasterizer Using OpenCV.

### Dependencies:
GLM
OpenCV

### Notes
This program is an extremely minimal software rasterizer for loading and rendering OBJ files. It remains a work-in-progress, thus far no code is implemented to draw more than wireframe triangles, handle edge cases, etc. Some code for line rasterization is adapted from http://www.edepot.com/algorithm.html and https://github.com/JesusHF/bresenham.
